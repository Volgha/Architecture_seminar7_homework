    <h6> How does spa work?
    In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, 
    JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a 
    single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded
    and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.
